# Turbo Data Miner

This extension adds a new tab `Turbo Miner` to Burp Suite's GUI as well as an new entry `Process in Turbo Data Miner 
(Proxy History Analyzer tab)` to Burp Suite's context menu. In the new tab, you are able to write new or select 
existing Python scripts that are executed on each request/response item currently stored in the Proxy History, Side 
Map, or on each request/response item that is sent or received by Burp Suite.  
  
The objective of these Python scripts is the flexible and dynamic extraction, correlation, and structured
presentation of information from the Burp Suite state as well as the flexible and dynamic on-the-fly modification
of outgoing or incoming HTTP requests. Thus, Turbo Data Miner shall aid in gaining a better and faster understanding of
the data collected and processed by Burp Suite.

The following screenshot provides an example how Turbo Data Miner can be used to obtain a structured presentation of all 
cookies (and their attributes) that are stored in the current Burp Suite project. At the bottom (see 1), you select 
the corresponding Python script in the combobox. By clicking button `Load Script`, the selected 
code is then loaded into the IDE text area and can be customized, if needed. Alternatively, you can create your own 
script by clicking button `New Script`. The analysis is started by clicking button `Start`. Afterwards, Turbo Data Miner 
executes the compiled Python script on each Request/Response item. Thereby, the script extracts cookie information 
from each response (see source code in 2) and adds it to the table (see 3). Finally, in the table, you can sort per 
column to gain a better understanding of each attribute or perform additional operations via the table's context menu 
(see 4).

As you can see, with Python skills, an understanding of the 
[Burp Suite Extender API](https://portswigger.net/Burp/extender/api/index.html) as well as an understanding of Turbo 
Miner's API (see Turbo Data Miner tab `About` or directly the 
[HTML page](https://github.com/chopicalqui/TurboDataMiner/blob/master/turbominer/about.html) used by the `About` tab), 
you can extract and structure any information available in the current Burp Suite project.


# Available Tabs

The `Turbo Miner` tab contains four additional tabs. Their purpose is described in this section.

## 1. Analyzers

The Python scripts in this tab usually structure the extracted information in a GUI table. From there, 
the results can be copied (as is or deduplicated) into the clipboard (e.g., to use them as payloads in the Intruder) 
or exported into a spreadsheet application for further (statistical) analyses.  
  
In this tab, you will find the following three analyzer plugins to extract and to display information in a 
structured way.

### Proxy History Analyzer

This analyzer executes the given Python script on each request/response item that is stored in Burp Suite's Proxy 
History. Use this analyzer to gather intelligence based on the data already stored in your Burp Suite project.

### Site Map Analyzer

This analyzer executes the given Python script on each request/response item that is stored in Burp Suite's Site 
Map. Use this analyzer to gather intelligence based on the data already stored in your Burp Suite project.

### HTTP Listener Analyzer

This analyzer implements the interface `IHttpListener` of the 
[Burp Suite Extender API](https://portswigger.net/Burp/extender/api/index.html). Thereby, it executes the current 
Python script after each response was received by Burp. Thus, if a request times out, then the Python script is not 
called for this request/response pair, and, as a result, this analyzer might not deliver complete results. Use this 
analyzer to gather intelligence from requests or responses that are currently sent or received (e.g., sent or 
received by Burp's Intruder for example).

## 2. Modifiers

Python scripts in this tab allow on the fly modifications on requests sent or responses received by Burp Suite. The 
following two modifiers are available.

### HTTP Listener Modifier

This modifier implements the interface `IHttpListener` of the 
[Burp Suite Extender API](https://portswigger.net/Burp/extender/api/index.html). Thereby, it executes the current 
Python script after each response was received by Burp. Thus, if a request times out, then the Python script is not 
called for this request/response pair, and, as a result, this analyzer might not deliver complete results. Use this 
analyzer to gather intelligence from requests or responses that are currently sent or received (e.g., sent or 
received by Burp's Intruder for example).

### Proxy Listener Modifier

This analyzer implements the interface `IProxyListener` of the 
[Burp Suite Extender API](https://portswigger.net/Burp/extender/api/index.html). Thereby, it executes the Python 
script after each request sent and response received.

## 3. Custom Message Editor

This tab implements the interface `IMessageEditorTab` of the 
[Burp Suite Extender API](https://portswigger.net/Burp/extender/api/index.html). Use it to implement an encoder 
and decoder tab, which is automatically added to each message editor. Your Python script must implement the following 
three methods; for more information refer to the `IMessageEditorTab` specification.

    def is_enabled(content, is_request, session):
        """
        This method is invoked before an HTTP message is displayed in an custom editor tab, so that this custom 
        tab can indicate whether it should be enabled for that message.
        
        For more information, refer to the Burp Suite API, IMessageEditorTab interface, method isEnabled.
        :param content (List[bytes]): The message that is about to be displayed by this custom editor tab, or a 
        zero-length array if the existing message is to be cleared.
        :param is_request (bool): Indicates whether the message is a request or a response.
        :param session (dict): The dictionary allows storing information accross method calls.
        :return (bool) If the custom tab is able to handle the specified message, and so will be displayed within the 
        editor. Otherwise, the tab will be hidden while this message is displayed.
	    """
        result = True
        # todo: implement code
        return result
    
    def set_message(content, is_request, session):
        """
        This method compiles the message to be displayed in this custom editor tab.
        
        For more information, refer to the Burp Suite API, IMessageEditorTab interface, method set_message.
        :param content (List[bytes]): The original message based on which the new message, which is going to be 
        displayed by this custom editor tab, is created.
        :param is_request (bool): Indicates whether the message is a request or a response.
        :param session (dict): The dictionary allows storing information accross method calls.
        :return (List[bytes]) Returns the modified content of variable content.
        """
        result = content
        # todo: decode content
        return result
    
    def get_message(content, session):
        """
        This method converts back the currently displayed message.
        
        For more information, refer to the Burp Suite API, IMessageEditorTab interface, method set_message.
        :param content (List[bytes]): The original message based on which the new message, which is going to be 
        displayed by this custom editor tab, is created.
        :param session (dict): The dictionary allows storing information accross method calls.
        :return (List[bytes]) Returns the modified content of variable content.
        """
        result = None
        # todo: encode contents
        return result

**Note:** The last parameter `session` is of type dictionary and can be used to store information across methods. 
The parameter `header` is of type list and can be used to specify column header names in the JTable component, 
which is part of the `IMessageEditorTab`. The parameter `rows` is a two-dimensional list, which can be used to add 
rows to the JTable component. For more information refer to the table in the next section.
